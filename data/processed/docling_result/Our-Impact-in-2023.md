PCAF's Data Quality Scores (score 1-5) are used to qualify the level of precision of the estimates we disclose per PCAF asset class. Data quality scores are specific to each asset class. Data with PCAF scores 1/2 , (verified and unverified respectively) company-level reported emissions data, represent the highest data quality and results in the most accurate emissions

disaggregate soy production emissions from the larger grains and oilseeds sector.

Our avoided emissions have increased by 10% - from 4.8 Mt CO2 to 5.3 Mt CO2. This increase is linked to a 25% increase in our loans to the renewable power generation sector. Rabobank plans to more than triple its investments in this sector by 2030

The biggest potential for positive impact lies in helping our customers transition to low-emitting business models. We haveÂ millions of customers around the world and we want all of them to successfully transition to the low-carbon future. However, we realize that the need to act and our ability to help differs per customer segment. Therefore, we have focused our

- 1 Note that the pathway and portfolio intensity numbers are aligned in emissions boundaries, but the values in the SBTi FLAG pathways are derived in a methodologically different way (the FLAG sector-region default value comes from a top-down model, our portfolio intensity value comes from a bottom-up calculator, with carbon footprints calculated based on primary data collected from our customers). This makes direct comparison difficult.
- 2 The performance measure is equal to the baseline reference year due to availability of data.
- 3 The 2020 financed emissions were not measured.
- 4 Financed (physical) volumes of oil and gas converted toÂ million barrels of oil equivalent/day. This is our first assessment of financed (physical) fossil volumes. We are working with other banks to develop a methodology for traded fossil fuels, which may differ from the current methodology
